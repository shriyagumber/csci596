# CSCI596
For the final project of CSCI596- 
Visualizing the molecular dynamics of C-defect modified 2D- graphitic Carbon Nitride simulated using machine learning force field

# Classical v/s Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFF)

For a given configuration, the forces on individual atoms are calculated and newtonian equation of motion is numerically integrated at each time-step to advance the dynamics. 
How are these forces obtained- solving the SE equation? Use post-HF methods like CCSD is too expensive. Instead, force fields are used. 
Force on each atom is mostly sum of bonded (bonds, angles, dihedrals) plus non-bonded interactions (pairwise: LJ potential, vdW forces, electrostatics etc.).
Classical FFs give a reasonable description of chemical interactions, even though the quality of these simulations is ultimately limited. 

In MLFF, the key conecpt is to come up with an analytical expression that relates the atomic configuration to its potential energy. 
MLFF has no preconceived notion about the chemical bonds or the atomic interactions.
Narrows the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the eï¬ƒciency of classical FFs.

# Training
Dataset Information: ~30,000 data points collected from ab initio moleclar dynamics (AIMD) within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), at varied temperature: from 100K to 1200K.
